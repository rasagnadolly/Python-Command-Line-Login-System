# Python-Command-Line-Login-System
This project is a simple yet secure command-line login system implemented in Python. It uses SHA-256 hashing to securely store and verify user passwords, ensuring that plaintext passwords are never saved in the system. User credentials are stored in a JSON file for persistence, and the program provides multiple login attempts before denying access.
